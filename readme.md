## Computerized Bouquet of Lego Roses for Valentine's Day

This project connects a Raspi to string LED lights and wraps a bouquet of Lego roses with the string lights. There are a few different variants.

### Using a Fairy Warm White Lights 

Get fairy string LED lights, such as [this one](https://www.adafruit.com/product/893) and [this one](https://www.amazon.com/Waterproof-Fireflies-Christmas-Valentines-Decoration/dp/B0BN8543JL). Remove the coin cell holder from LED wires, and connect the wires to a Raspi: the positive wire to a GPIO pin and the ground wire to a GND pin. Run [led-fade.py](code/led-fade.py).
